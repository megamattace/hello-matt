        <p>
          Landon is a self-proclaimed "Excuse Guru." Growing up in Mos Esley, ND, Landon was surrounded by the nation's best and brightest. He first began to find his way out of things in middle school, where he would skip wrestling practice because "his sister needed him to watch her pet fish while she went to an aunt's lakehouse in Bosnia." Landon joined the BumpThat team in 2014 and has singlehandeldy improved company morale 60% and renovated the building with an open design concept all while caring for his brother's pet alpaca.
